This is a simple little project that I made a few months ago, I wanted to create a keylogger because it's one of the scariest forms of spyware (in my humble opinion).
I tried to make it so that data from the keystrokes would be sent through the internet, but I do not have the necessary networking skills yet.
I have made it so that the code was as easy as possible to understand and thus, have not obfuscated the code.
Interestingly, the exe file that is produced from my code does not get detected by major antiviruses. However, please use it ethically. It may not be very complex, but,
getting information on how to create a keylogger is not easy.

Features of the little project:
- A file that contains all the info from keys pressed
- Said file remains modifiable even after the computer is shutdown (the "special" feature needs to be activated nonetheless)
- lightweight on the system
